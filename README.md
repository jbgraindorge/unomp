# unified-node-open-mining-portal
A docker build of: unified-node-open-mining-portal.

https://github.com/UNOMP/unified-node-open-mining-portal/blob/master/config.json.example

This container is supposed to be used with redis, for this I am using a seperate container.
These could be deployed together using a stackfile, see stackfile.example.

This file also contains the needed ports and volumes.
